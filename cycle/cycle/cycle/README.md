# Cycle

The best rides are the ones where you
bite off much more than you can chew,
and live through it.

## Overview

Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that
leave a trail behind them, while at the same time trying to eat the feed to 
score points.

## Rules

Cycle is played according to the following rules:`

Players can move up, down, left and right...
Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.
Each player's trail grows as they move.

If a player is ahead, they try to maneuver so one of the players collides with 
their opponents tail, while at the same time trying to eat the food to score 
more points. 

If a player is behind, they try to avoid either player crossing an oponent's
tail, while at the same time trying to eat the food.

If a player collides with their opponent's tail...
The game is over, and the player with the most points is the winner.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed 
and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a 
terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to 
the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 cycle
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your 
IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter 
folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- cycle               (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
